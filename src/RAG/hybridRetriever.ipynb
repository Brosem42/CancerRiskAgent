    "# **Challenges + Mitigation strategies for Performing Vector Search:**\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### **Tradeoffs:**\n",
    "- Originally, my plan was to use the same framework for both retrievers, then fetch the data from my vector store in chroma. However, I found that my BM25 retriever simply would not return any data for either framework--langchain or llamaindex. Later on, I found out that due to how the BM25-Retriever architecture is built, the keyword search library needs access to pull data from **raw text nodes**. This does not align with my current Chroma vector store DB architecture, which is built **with stored embeddings--not original text**. Hence, why orginally no data was being returned in my prior iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How I solved for this/Why I chose this method?:**\n",
    "To mitigate for this, I decided to change my framework and use llamaindex for BM25/lexical retriever; it provides a much more seamless integration with the Chroma vector store architecture. Then, I used llamaindex to pass my list of nodes directly to the BM25 retriever, which solved the short-term problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Improvement with Llama_Index:**\n",
    "- Use raw text nodes for BM25 retrieval to ensure compatibility with the keyword search library\n",
    "- Implement response enhancement by providing additional context or *page_content* for my document queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Pitfall/Tradeoffs with my original approach:**\n",
    "While attempting to test the combination of langchain and llamaIndex for different retrievers, I came across multiple problems. The main issue, my database and embeddings are in ChromaDB. The issue arises when performing a hybrid retrieval--where you **combine both a semantic, dense retriever and a lexical, keyword precise retriever**. The **root problem stemmed from BM25's architecture**. Semantic retriever seamlessy integrates with my dB because it uses the **vector_store from Chroma**. My BM25 does not integrate well because it **must pass the queried Document objects as nodes**--**something that can only be performed with VectorStoreIndex in LlamaIndex**. Being that Chroma is very langchain dependent and VectorStoreIndex is LlamaIndex dependant, combining these two very different methods would result in uneccessary overhead. I also had to factor in the limited constraint of having to use Gemini 1.5 with VertexAI embeddings, which is a closed-solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If I had to start over, to successfully integrate a hybrid retrieval RAG, I would have used either **OpenAI embeddings, ChatGPT4o, and ChromaDB** to still keep the closed-source solution in production. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If building proof of concept locally, I would use **FAISS for my vector store** + replace my **model with Gemma from HuggingFace.** for a more open source solution.\n",

    "\n",
    "## My main consideration...**How can I pivot without losing retrieval quality?****\n",
    "My plan is to move to a more powerful approach by performing accurate similarity search with my **vector_store in ChromaDb** as my retriever in langchain. This is done to obtain exact matches with the potential of ingesting large documents via **Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) algorithm built-in to ChromaDB**. Then, I will apply **Maximum Marginal Relevance(MMR)**. It's a great pivot from my prior solution. I'm able to optimize for balance between **relevance and diversity in a faster time complexity**. In a live healthcare environment, my agent would come in contact with multiple provider oppinions. In order to accurately generate responses that mimic live production, I would need to compensate for scaling this factor later on. Hence, whyn I chose this method.\n",

Also, one of the key constraints in building this agent included a task to cite the specific sources within the relevant data retrieved from the NG12 documents.
